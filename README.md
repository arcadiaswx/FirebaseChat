This is a simple chat application using Firebase.

Though I have used my own Firebase storage repo which all of you can also use but I would definitely recommend to create your personal storage in the Firebase. All I am saying this because it's a Anonymous chat app which is basically using a single database in Firebase. So whoever will be using my codebase will actually be using a single DB!

You can change the storage URL from **Constants.swift** file 
which is currently declared as **gs://locationchat-3d569.appspot.com** 

Please make sure that you have created your own storage url before using this application. 

**Also please change your bundle id to whatever you have used to create the project in Firebase** ### **This is mandatory** ###
